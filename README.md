# LowPolyGame

This is polygonal game world where I try check possibilities of
pure javascript with visual browser engine.

Here you can find everything you need to develop and implement three-dimensional browser games with an open world.

The project provides ample opportunities to create unique game worlds where each player can become the creator of their own story. You will be able to enjoy freedom and creativity, covering a variety of genres - from fantasy to science fiction and even historical eras.

Thanks to the possibility of crafting, battles, construction and multiplayer, you will be able to create your own virtual world in which you will travel, fight, create and share your achievements with other players.

I invite you to join our community of developers, share your ideas, participate in the creation of unique projects and enjoy the limitless possibilities of our three-dimensional polygonal world.

Welcome to the world of creativity and adventure! Start your journey now and create your own game universe!
